## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
- Main branch: `main` (stable releases)
- Development branch: `develop` 
- Feature branches: `feature/description`
- Commit convention: `type(scope): description`
  - feat: New feature
  - fix: Bug fix
  - docs: Documentation
  - perf: Performance improvement
  - refactor: Code restructuring

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Each module has accompanying tests
2. **Integration Tests**: System interaction tests
3. **Simulation Tests**: Long-running ecosystem tests
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical paths
5. **Property Tests**: Genetic algorithm correctness

### Code Quality Standards
- All code must pass `cargo clippy`
- Format with `cargo fmt`
- Document all public APIs
- Maintain test coverage >80%
- Performance benchmarks for critical systems

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Risks
- **Risk**: Simulation slows with 1000+ creatures
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Implement spatial partitioning early
  - Use data-oriented design
  - Profile regularly
  - Implement LOD system

### Complexity Risks
- **Risk**: Emergent behaviors too complex to debug
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive logging system
  - Time-travel debugging
  - Visualization tools for AI decisions
  - Isolated system testing

### Scope Risks
- **Risk**: Feature creep
- **Mitigation**:
  - Strict phase boundaries
  - Core features first
  - Optional features clearly marked
  - Regular milestone reviews
