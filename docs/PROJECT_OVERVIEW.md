# Project Overview

## Project Name
Artificial Life Simulation (Working Title)

## Vision Statement
Create an engaging simulation where autonomous creatures with genetic traits and social behaviors evolve over time, allowing users to observe emergent behaviors and evolutionary patterns across multiple time scales.

## Problem Statement
Most artificial life simulations focus either on genetic evolution OR social behavior, but rarely combine both with meaningful inter-creature communication that affects decision-making. Additionally, many simulations lock users into a single time scale, making it difficult to observe both immediate behaviors and long-term evolutionary trends.

## Target Users
- Researchers and students interested in artificial life, evolution, and emergent behavior
- Game designers exploring procedural generation and AI behaviors
- Hobbyists fascinated by complex systems and simulations
- Educators teaching concepts of evolution, genetics, and social dynamics

## Key Features
1. **Autonomous Creatures** - Each creature has:
   - Multiple needs (hunger, thirst, social, reproduction, safety, etc.)
   - Decision-making system based on need priorities
   - Unique genetic traits that affect behavior and capabilities

2. **Genetic System**
   - DNA representation for inheritable traits
   - Sexual reproduction with trait mixing
   - Mutations for evolutionary variety
   - Natural selection through survival pressures

3. **Social Interactions**
   - Creatures can communicate through conversations
   - Social interactions influence decision-making
   - Formation of relationships and social groups
   - Cultural knowledge transfer between creatures

4. **Dynamic Time Control**
   - Multiple clock speeds from real-time to generational
   - Smooth transitions between time scales
   - Ability to focus on individual creatures or population-level changes

5. **Interactive World**
   - Procedurally generated world with diverse biomes
   - Resources that creatures need to survive
   - Environmental challenges and opportunities
   - Spatial movement and territory
   - Dynamic weather and day/night cycles
   - Animated environmental elements (swaying grass, flowing water)

## Success Criteria
- Creatures exhibit believable, needs-driven behavior
- Evolutionary patterns emerge over generations
- Social interactions meaningfully impact creature survival and behavior
- Users can easily observe phenomena at different time scales
- **System maintains 60+ FPS with 5000+ active creatures**
- **Smooth performance enables rich animations and complex behaviors**
- Memory usage remains under 2GB
- Emergent behaviors surprise and engage users

## Constraints & Assumptions
- Technical constraints:
  - Must handle 100-1000 simultaneous creatures efficiently
  - Real-time rendering at highest time speeds
  - Memory-efficient DNA/trait storage
  
- Design constraints:
  - UI must clearly show both individual and population data
  - Conversations must be meaningful but computationally feasible
  
- Assumptions:
  - Users have basic understanding of evolution concepts
  - Modern hardware (2020+ consumer PCs)
  - Single-player experience (no networking initially)
