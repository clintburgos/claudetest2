Welcome to the Artificial Life Simulation project documentation. This index provides quick access to all documentation files.

## 📋 Core Documents

- [Project Overview](./PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) - Vision, goals, and high-level architecture
- [Design Decisions](./design/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md) - Log of all architectural decisions
- [Implementation Plan](./implementation/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) - Development roadmap and phases
- [Testing Strategy](./TESTING_STRATEGY.md) - TDD approach and testing guidelines
- [Quick Start](./QUICK_START.md) - Setup instructions and first steps

## 🧬 System Design Documents

- [Creature Design](./design/CREATURE_DESIGN.md) - Creature components and lifecycle
- [Genetics System](./design/GENETICS_SYSTEM.md) - DNA, inheritance, and mutations
- [Social System](./design/SOCIAL_SYSTEM.md) - Communication and relationships
- [Time Scaling](./design/TIME_SCALING.md) - Multi-scale time system design

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Understand the Vision**: Start with [Project Overview](./PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)
2. **Review Architecture**: Check [Design Decisions](./design/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md) for key choices
3. **Explore Systems**: Read system-specific design documents
4. **Follow Development**: Track progress in [Implementation Plan](./implementation/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)

## 📊 Key Design Decisions

- **DD-001**: Documentation-first approach
- **DD-002**: Entity-Component-System architecture
- **DD-003**: Gene-based genetic system
- **DD-004**: Needs-based AI decision making
- **DD-005**: Concept-based conversation system
- **DD-006**: Hierarchical time scaling
- **DD-007**: Rust + wgpu technology stack
- **DD-008**: Test-Driven Development methodology

## 🎯 Current Phase

We are currently in the **Planning & Design Phase**, preparing for Phase 1 implementation.

## 📝 Documentation Guidelines

- Keep all documentation up to date
- Use clear, concise language
- Include dates on all decisions
- Link between related documents
- Use diagrams where helpful
- Document assumptions explicitly
