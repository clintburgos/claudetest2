# Presentation Layer Setup - Phase 1 Weeks 7-8 Ready

## Overview

The codebase has been successfully refactored from a terminal-based simulation to a proper Bevy graphical application, making it ready for Phase 1 weeks 7-8 implementation.

## Completed Fixes

### 1. Bevy App Structure ✓
- Transformed main.rs from terminal loop to Bevy App
- Proper plugin architecture with modular design
- Window creation with 1280x720 resolution

### 2. Camera System ✓
- Full camera controls implemented (WASD/Arrows for movement)
- Zoom functionality (Q/E keys)
- Configurable speed and zoom limits
- Ready for isometric view implementation

### 3. Rendering Infrastructure ✓
- Sprite-based rendering for creatures and resources
- Color-coded entities (green creatures, brown food, blue water)
- Automatic sprite creation for new entities
- Position synchronization between simulation and rendering

### 4. Isometric Pipeline ✓
- Isometric coordinate transformation functions
- Proper depth sorting for sprite layering
- Modular isometric plugin architecture

### 5. Input System ✓
- Keyboard input handling integrated
- Camera controls responsive
- Debug toggle keys (F1-F4) implemented

### 6. UI Foundation ✓
- Basic UI without external dependencies (egui temporarily removed due to Rust version compatibility)
- FPS counter display
- Entity count statistics
- Control instructions overlay
- Ready for egui integration when Rust is updated

### 7. Debug Overlay ✓
- F1: Toggle FPS display
- F2: Toggle entity IDs
- F3: Toggle creature states
- F4: Toggle spatial grid visualization
- Gizmo-based debug rendering

### 8. ECS Bridge ✓
- Simulation entities properly integrated with Bevy ECS
- Component-based architecture for all game objects
- Automatic spatial grid updates
- Proper system ordering and dependencies

## Known Limitations

1. **No egui**: Due to Rust 1.81 compatibility issues, egui is temporarily disabled. UI uses Bevy's built-in text rendering.
2. **Placeholder Graphics**: Using colored rectangles instead of sprite assets
3. **Basic UI**: Text-based UI instead of full egui panels

## Next Steps for Weeks 7-8

1. **Enhance Camera System**
   - Add mouse-based panning
   - Implement smooth camera following
   - Add camera bounds to keep within world limits

2. **Improve Rendering**
   - Load actual sprite assets
   - Add sprite animations
   - Implement creature state visualizations

3. **Expand UI**
   - Update to Rust 1.82+ and re-enable egui
   - Create information panels
   - Add creature selection and inspection

4. **Polish Debug Tools**
   - Visual health bars
   - Need indicators
   - Performance graphs

## Technical Notes

- Using Bevy 0.13 for stability
- Spatial grid cell size: 50 units
- Initial spawn: 50 creatures, 60 resources
- Frame budget target: 60 FPS

The codebase is now properly structured as a Bevy application with all the foundational systems needed for the presentation layer implementation in weeks 7-8.
