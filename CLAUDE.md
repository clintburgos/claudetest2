# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a creature simulation project in active development. Phase 1 implementation is underway.

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Core simulation systems implemented (weeks 1-6)
- ‚úÖ Bevy graphical application structure ready
- ‚úÖ egui UI integration complete
- üöß Working on Phase 1 weeks 7-8 (presentation layer)
- üìç See `/docs/PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for current phase details

## Documentation Navigation

**New engineers should start with these navigation tools:**

## Key Design Decisions

### Visual Design
- **View**: Isometric perspective (30¬∞/45¬∞ angle)
- **Art Style**: Cartoonish, over-exaggerated expressions
- **Creature Visibility**: Multiple systems ensure creatures remain visible when behind objects
- **Expression System**: Rich emotional displays with particles, colors, and animations

### World Design
- **Procedural Generation**: Seed-based world generation using Perlin noise
- **Biomes**: 8 distinct biomes with realistic transitions
- **Animated Environment**: Swaying grass, trees, water ripples, weather effects
- **Day/Night Cycle**: Dynamic lighting and weather systems

### Controls & Interface
- **Multi-scale Navigation**: Seamless zoom from world overview to individual creatures
- **Time Control**: 6 speed settings from pause to 1000x generational time
- **Smart Selection**: Click to select, follow mode, multi-select capabilities
- **Data Visualization**: 4 main views (Overview, Population, Genetics, Trends)
- **Adaptive UI**: Interface elements scale with zoom level

### Technical Implementation
- **Game Engine**: Bevy (Rust) with ECS architecture
- **UI Framework**: egui for immediate mode GUI
- **Rendering**: bevy_ecs_tilemap for isometric tiles
- **Performance**: Aggressive optimization for 5000+ creatures at 60+ FPS
  - Spatial indexing for O(log n) queries
  - LOD system for animations and AI
  - Parallel processing with Rayon
  - Cache-friendly component design
- **Modular Architecture**: Separated simulation, world, rendering, and UI systems
