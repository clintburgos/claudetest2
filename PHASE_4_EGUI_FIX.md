# EguiPlugin Duplicate Fix

## Issue
When running `cargo run --bin=creature_simulation`, the application panicked with:
```
plugin was already added in application
```

## Root Cause
The `EguiPlugin` was being added twice:
1. In `src/main.rs` at line 27: `.add_plugins(EguiPlugin)`
2. In `UiEguiPlugin` which also tried to add `EguiPlugin`

## Solution
Modified `src/plugins/ui_egui.rs` to check if `EguiPlugin` is already added before attempting to add it:

```rust
impl Plugin for UiEguiPlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        // Only add EguiPlugin if it hasn't been added yet
        if !app.is_plugin_added::<EguiPlugin>() {
            app.add_plugins(EguiPlugin);
        }
        
        app.init_resource::<UiState>()
            .add_systems(Update, ui_system);
    }
}
```

## Result
The main application now builds and runs successfully without the duplicate plugin panic.

## How to Run
```bash
cargo run --bin=creature_simulation
```

Or for release mode with better performance:
```bash
cargo run --release --bin=creature_simulation
```
