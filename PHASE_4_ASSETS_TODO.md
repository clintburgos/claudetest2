# Phase 4 Assets TODO

## Current Status
Phase 4 code implementation is complete, but runtime issues exist due to missing assets.

## Asset Issues Found

### 1. Font Issue
- **File**: `assets/fonts/FiraMono-Medium.ttf`
- **Problem**: File exists but is only 15 bytes (placeholder)
- **Solution**: Need to either:
  - Download actual FiraMono font from Google Fonts
  - Use a different font that's available
  - Make font loading optional/fallback gracefully

### 2. Created Placeholder UI Assets
The following placeholder assets have been created but are basic shapes:
- `assets/sprites/ui/health_bar_bg.png` - Gray rectangle
- `assets/sprites/ui/health_bar_fill.png` - Green rectangle  
- `assets/sprites/ui/health_bar_frame.png` - Black border
- `assets/sprites/ui/speech_bubble.png` - White rounded rectangle
- `assets/sprites/ui/thought_bubble.png` - Cloud shape
- `assets/sprites/ui/shout_bubble.png` - Spiky bubble
- `assets/sprites/ui/emoji_atlas.png` - Grid of emoji placeholders
- `assets/sprites/ui/icons/*.png` - Various icon placeholders
- `assets/sprites/particles/particle_atlas.png` - Particle texture atlas

### 3. EguiPlugin Issue (FIXED)
- **Problem**: `UiEguiPlugin` wasn't adding the base `EguiPlugin`
- **Solution**: Added `app.add_plugins(EguiPlugin)` to the plugin initialization

## How to Fix Font Issue

### Option 1: Download Real Font
```bash
# Download FiraMono from Google Fonts
curl -L "https://github.com/mozilla/Fira/raw/master/ttf/FiraMono-Medium.ttf" \
  -o assets/fonts/FiraMono-Medium.ttf
```

### Option 2: Use System Font
Modify the code to use a system font or make font loading optional.

### Option 3: Skip Font Loading
Make the text rendering fallback gracefully when fonts fail to load.

## Testing Phase 4

### Without UI (Recommended for now)
```bash
cargo run --example phase4_test
```

### With Full UI (after fixing fonts)
```bash
cargo run --example phase4_demo
```

## Phase 4 Features Working
- ✅ Particle system with pooling
- ✅ Weather state machine
- ✅ Quality settings with presets
- ✅ Enhanced speech bubbles (code complete)
- ✅ Floating UI system (code complete)
- ✅ All tests passing

The implementation is complete and functional - only asset loading issues remain.
