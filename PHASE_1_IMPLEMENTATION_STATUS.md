# Phase 1 Implementation Status Report

## Overview
This report compares the current implementation against Phase 1 Week 1-8 requirements from the implementation guide.

## Week 1-2: Foundation Systems

### Entity System ❌ MISSING
**Required:** Simple entity IDs, not full ECS
**Current:** Using Bevy's full ECS system instead of simple entity management
- No custom EntityId or EntityManager implementation
- Relying on Bevy's Entity type and ECS architecture

### Spatial Grid ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Required:** 50-unit cells for ~10 creatures per cell
**Current:** Fully implemented in `src/plugins/spatial.rs`
- Cell size: 50.0 units (configurable)
- Efficient HashMap-based grid with O(1) entity removal
- Query methods: `query_radius()` and `query_radius_filtered()`
- Automatic updates when entities move
- Comprehensive unit tests

### Time System ⚠️ PARTIAL
**Required:** Fixed timestep, max 10x speed
**Current:** Configuration exists but no custom time system
- Time constants defined in `src/config.rs`
- FIXED_TIMESTEP: 1/60 second
- MAX_TIME_SCALE: 10.0
- Using Bevy's built-in Time resource instead of custom implementation
- Speed multiplier in SimulationSettings but no fixed timestep implementation

### Event System ❌ MISSING
**Required:** Basic event bus
**Current:** Using Bevy's event system, no custom implementation
- Events defined (CreatureDiedEvent, ResourceConsumedEvent)
- But no simple event bus as specified

## Week 3-4: Creatures

### Creature Struct ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Required:** Basic needs (hunger, thirst, energy)
**Current:** Fully implemented
- `Creature` marker component
- `Needs` component with hunger, thirst, energy, social
- `Health` component with current/max values
- `Age`, `Size`, `CreatureState`, `CreatureType` components
- `CreatureBundle` for easy spawning

### Movement System ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Required:** Simple point-to-point movement
**Current:** Implemented in `movement_system`
- Velocity-based movement
- Target following (position or entity)
- Speed modifiers based on creature size
- Arrival detection

### Health System ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Required:** Basic health tracking
**Current:** Implemented
- Health component with damage/heal methods
- Death checking system
- Multiple death causes (starvation, dehydration, exhaustion, old age)

## Week 5-6: Behavior

### Resource Spawning ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Required:** Food and water resources
**Current:** Implemented in `src/plugins/spawn.rs`
- Food and Water resource types
- Initial spawning of resources
- ResourceAmount tracking with consumption
- Regeneration rates configured

### Decision Making ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Required:** Priority-based needs satisfaction
**Current:** Fully implemented in `decision_system`
- Priority-based decision making
- Flee from threats behavior
- Resource seeking based on needs
- Social behavior
- Wander when idle
- State transitions

### Need Satisfaction ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Required:** Consume resources to satisfy needs
**Current:** Implemented in `consumption_system`
- Creatures consume resources when in Eating/Drinking states
- Needs update based on consumption
- Resource depletion tracking

## Week 7-8: Presentation

### Camera Controls ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Required:** Pan, zoom, follow
**Current:** Fully implemented in `src/plugins/camera.rs`
- WASD/Arrow key panning
- Q/E and mouse wheel zoom
- Min/max zoom limits
- Mouse drag panning (middle/right button)
- Entity following with smooth lerp
- ESC to stop following

### Basic Rendering ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Required:** Simple 2D sprites
**Current:** Implemented using Bevy's sprite system
- Colored sprites for creatures and resources
- Transform-based positioning
- Sprite sizing
- Layer ordering (creatures on top)

### Minimal UI ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Required:** FPS, entity counts, time controls
**Current:** Implemented with egui in `src/plugins/ui_egui.rs`
- FPS display
- Creature and resource counts
- Pause/play controls
- Speed multiplier (0.5x to 10x)
- Statistics window
- Debug overlays (F1-F4)
- Creature selection and inspection

## Summary

### ✅ Implemented (10/13 items - 77%)
1. Spatial Grid System
2. Creature Struct with Needs
3. Movement System
4. Health System
5. Resource Spawning
6. Decision Making
7. Need Satisfaction
8. Camera Controls
9. Basic Rendering
10. Minimal UI

### ⚠️ Partial (1/13 items - 8%)
1. Time System - configuration exists but using Bevy's time instead of custom

### ❌ Missing (2/13 items - 15%)
1. Entity System - using Bevy ECS instead of simple entity IDs
2. Event System - using Bevy events instead of basic event bus

## Key Architectural Difference
The implementation uses Bevy's ECS architecture throughout instead of the simpler custom systems specified in Phase 1. This is more complex than required but provides a solid foundation for future phases. The core gameplay features are all present and functional.

## Performance
- Current: 50 creatures + 60 resources running smoothly
- Target: 500 creatures at 60 FPS
- Need to test with full creature count

## Next Steps
1. Performance test with 500 creatures
2. Consider if custom Entity/Event systems are needed or if Bevy's are sufficient
3. Implement fixed timestep for deterministic simulation
4. Add resource spawning system to maintain resource density
