# Phase 4 Runtime Fixes

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Empty Range Panic in Particle System
**Problem**: The particle system was panicking with "cannot sample empty range" when trying to generate random numbers.

**Root Causes**:
1. Box spawn pattern with 0-sized dimensions (e.g., Y=0 for weather particles)
2. Circle/Sphere patterns with 0 radius
3. Random velocity distributions where min >= max
4. Lifetime ranges where min >= max

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added guards for Box pattern to check if size > 0 before generating random positions
- Added guards for Circle/Sphere patterns to check if radius > 0
- Added guards for Random velocity to ensure min < max
- Added guard for lifetime range to ensure valid range

### 2. Missing Resources in UI System
**Problem**: The egui UI system was trying to access resources that weren't initialized.

**Fix**: Added initialization of required resources in the demo:
```rust
.init_resource::<SimulationSettings>()
.init_resource::<SimulationControl>()
.init_resource::<PerformanceMonitor>()
.init_resource::<ObservationGoals>()
```

## How to Run Phase 4 Demos

### Simple Demo (Recommended)
```bash
cargo run --example phase4_simple
```
This demo has minimal dependencies and demonstrates quality settings and weather changes.

### Full Demo
```bash
cargo run --example phase4_demo
```
This requires all UI resources to be properly initialized.

### Test Demo
```bash
cargo run --example phase4_test
```
Minimal test without UI dependencies.

## Verification
All empty range issues have been fixed by adding proper bounds checking before using `gen_range()`. The particle system now handles edge cases gracefully.
