# Creature Simulation - Phase 1 Implementation

## Overview

This is the Phase 1 implementation of a creature simulation project, targeting 500 creatures at 60 FPS. The focus is on building core systems with simple, extensible architecture.

## Project Status

### Week 1-2 Goals: ✅ COMPLETED

All foundational systems have been implemented with comprehensive test coverage (31 tests passing).

### Implemented Systems

#### Core Layer
- **Entity System**: Simple entity IDs with recycling
- **Time System**: Fixed timestep with pause/scale controls (max 10x)
- **Spatial Grid**: 50-unit cells for efficient proximity queries
- **Event Bus**: Async event handling with nested event support
- **Error Boundary**: Graceful error recovery and logging

#### Simulation Layer (Data Structures)
- **Creature**: Basic creature with position, health, needs, and states
- **Resource**: Food/Water resources with consumption/regeneration
- **Health**: Damage/healing system with death detection
- **Needs**: Hunger/thirst/energy with metabolism rates

## Architecture

```

├── core/           # Core systems (Entity, Time, Spatial, Events, Error)
├── simulation/     # Game entities (Creature, Resource, Health, Needs)
├── systems/        # System implementations (TODO)
├── utils/          # Utility functions (TODO)
└── lib.rs          # Library root
```

## Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

All 31 tests should pass, covering:
- Entity creation/destruction/recycling
- Time system with pause/scale/fixed timestep
- Spatial grid queries (radius/rect)
- Event processing with nested events
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Creature lifecycle
- Resource consumption/regeneration
- Health and needs systems

## Next Steps (Week 3-4)

1. **Movement System**: Implement point-to-point movement
2. **Needs System**: Update needs based on creature state
3. **Decision System**: Priority-based need satisfaction
4. **Resource System**: Spawning and regeneration
5. **World Integration**: Connect all systems together

## Performance Targets

- 500 creatures at 60 FPS
- 16ms frame budget (6ms update, 10ms render)
- Memory usage: ~100MB total

## Dependencies

- `glam`: Math and geometry
- `ahash`: Fast hashing for collections
- `rand` + `rand_xorshift`: Deterministic RNG
- `log` + `env_logger`: Logging infrastructure
- `thiserror` + `anyhow`: Error handling

## Building for Release

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Release profile includes LTO and single codegen unit for maximum performance.
